# helib-dockerfile

Instructions:

0. Install Docker (if not installed) using instructions found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/.
1. Edit `index.cpp` as needed.
2. Run `docker build .`

Note: First build will take a long time (~10 minutes) due to the nature of Docker. After that, the only wait time should be the run and compile time of your program.
